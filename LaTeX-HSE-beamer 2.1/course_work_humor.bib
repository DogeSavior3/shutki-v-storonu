	abstract = {The paper deals with semantic and sentiment trajectories of literary masterpieces (we used corpora of 12 languages of various language families), composed of individual embeddings or n-grams. We ascertain that, for all languages, semantic and sentiment trajectories are markedly chaotic: positive largest Lyapunov exponents; ‘entropy-complexity’ pairs belonging to the ‘chaotic’ area of the respective plane; the distinctive ‘chaotic’ drop of the number of false nearest neighbours at a particular value of an embedding dimension. The Russian language turns out to be more ‘chaotic’ than, for example, the English one; we attribute this fact to the free order of words. The Esperanto language, for various ‘approaches’ to different Indo-European languages. The results do not corroborate its claim to be equidistant from all languages. However, it seems to be equidistant from all Indo-European languages. These characteristics are utilised in order to develop a method to compare styles of an original masterpiece and its translations (to automatically assess translation quality). It appears that machine translations are still worse than human ones, however, for example, the Facebook translation is comparable with them.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, technology is rapidly advancing: bots are writing comments, articles, and reviews. Due to this fact, it is crucial to know if the text was written by a human or by a bot. This paper focuses on comparing structures of the coarse-grained partitions of semantic paths for human-written and bot-generated texts. We compare the clusterizations of datasets of n-grams from literary texts and texts generated by several bots. The hypothesis is that the structures and clusterizations are different. Our research supports the hypothesis. As the semantic structure may be different for different languages, we investigate Russian, English, German, and Vietnamese languages.},

            The National Research University Higher School of Economics launched its HPC cluster and created a new division named the Supercomputer Simulation Unit. Now the university HPC cluster occupies seventh place in rating the most powerful computers of the CIS TOP50. The HPC cluster uses to solve machine learning problems, population genomics, hydrodynamics, atomistic and continuous modeling in physics, generative probabilistic models, financial row forecasting algorithms, and other actual problems. Paper describes the HSE HPC resources and experience of their use for scientific and educational tasks.},
